ðŸ’¼ Software Technologies Engineer (degree at UANL) .

ðŸ“° I like to learn new programming languages with new technologies and modern procedures to solve problems.

ðŸ”­ Mainly focused as backend developer using Spring Boot (Kotlin/Java), but I also have knowledge about frontend development using Angular 12.

ðŸŒ± Programming has no limits (except for physical limitations such as hardware), it is a universe in which we can explore and in which we can develop our creative and logical skills. The number of possibilities to solve a problem are infinite and we are free to use our imagination and our reasoning to make the best and optimized way to solve it, so, in fact, programming is a kind of art, that unfortunately, many times everyone not sees.
